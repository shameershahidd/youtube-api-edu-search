"Learn Letters, Chain Reactions, Physics, Recycling and more | 7 Cartoons with Max and Friends!",coilbook‚Ñ¢ | Learning For Children,"This educational compilation includes 7 short cartoons with Max the Glow Train and Friends! 

1. ""Chain Reactions"" - Max the Glow Train and his friends learn numbers, shapes and colors while using educational chain reactions. Suddenly, Alex the Helicopter flies in and tells them that Bubble the Robot is stuck in a basketball hoop and needs help. The clever toys then decide to build a giant chain reaction set using toy cars, buses, 3d shapes, boats, dominoes, marbles, and even a toy train. With your help, Bubble the Robot is in good hands! 

2. ""Toby the Garbage Truck"" - It's a beautiful day in the park for a toy car race! Joe the Monster Truck and Blazin' Bill the Monster Truck teach race cars how to race. Max the Glow Train and his friends arrive to watch the show too. One of Max's new friends is Toby the Garbage Truck. 
  While the toys watch the car race, Toby the Garbage Truck is too busy finding trash in the park here and there. 
   After the race, the toys clean after themselves and start heading home. Toby the Garbage Truck discovers a dirty pond full of trash. The toys have to act fast to help clean the pond and recycle all the trash! Let's keep this planet clean! 

3. ""Read with us"" - Max the Glow Train and his friends receive an unusual device called a Word Machine. After they read a word the machine makes a toy. Something happens and the machine goes out of control!

5. ""Chain Reactions | Physics"" - Max the Glow Train and his friends arrive at the Robo-J5‚Äôs physics lab. This lab uses chain reactions to study gravity, magnetism, lights, heat and energy, buoyancy, friction and simple machines.

  Next, Cube the Robot gets a message from Robo-J5 saying that she can help the turtle. All they have to do is take the mine train to get to her.  While on their way to see Robo-J5, the toys do more good deeds by helping other animals!  
   One of Max‚Äôs friends is a small curious robot named Clam.  While Robo-J5 explains about physics, curious Clam activates a chain reaction machine. The toys use physics to help Clam!

7. ""Learn Letters"" - Join this amazing adventure with Max the Glow Train, letters and toys.  
 Max is a fun loving toy train who teaches children the English alphabet. On his way to the zoo Max meets the letters and takes them with him.

The robot jumps onto the kitchen counter and accidentally turns the water on.
   While the toys are counting fruits and vegetables, the kitchen sink is overflowing... It's good that Max the Glow Train has friends like Fen the Boat and Kai the Submarine.  These two help save the day!

The Heckman Curve
https://heckmanequation.org/resource/the-heckman-curve/
 

What a child experiences during the first years of their life has a lasting impact on the development of their brain. While genes set the roadmap, experiences create the neural connection inside the brain that sets the foundations of our emotions, language,  motor skills,  vision, and memories. If one region gets additional stimulation,  the neural pathways within that area and the connections to other areas grow stronger. This process is called synaptic pruning. 
 
You can also imagine your brain as a planet. There is Motor Skill Metropolis, Memory Mountain and Vision Village. Through the years, popular cities grow bigger and links between them get larger. Now if one area was never developed, there can be traffic jams. This then slows down the development of the entire brain. Some neurotransmitters will be tired of getting to work. Others will take short cuts and get lost.
 
Imagine your brain is a planet. Big cities have many houses, roads, and connections to travel to other big cities. If they are popular, over time those cities and links between them grow bigger and stronger. But if one town was never developed, citizens will have trouble to get around. As a result, there is little business and traffic jam for everyone who wants to pass through. This limits not only the development of that area but limits the growth of the entire ecosystem.
 
Betty Hart and Todd Risley studied children‚Äôs exposure to language.  On average children from families on welfare were exposed to about  600 words per hour.  Kids from rich families got about  2,000.  By the age of 3, the gap becomes 30 million words. But it didn‚Äôt end there.  Children from privileged families received much more positive feedback.  For every 6 words of praise,  there was only one word of discouragement. Welfare kids, however,  heard twice as many discouragements than praise. This could make a difference that lasts a lifetime. 
 
In a study that began in 1963, psychologist David Weikart and his team randomly divided 123 underprivileged kids into two groups.  One group spent two years at a top preschool with excellent teachers.  They made art, discussed problems, and received a lot of attention, respect, and love. For the other, life went on as usual.  Often without much attention from anyone  40 years later the Highscope Perry Preschool Study was published.
 
At age five, 67% of the children in the top preschool group had an IQ of over 90,  they were school-ready. Of the others, only 28% achieved that.  At fourteen there was a big difference in basic classroom achievements. At twenty-seven the top preschool group was more likely to own their own home.  And at age forty they earned more money and were less likely to ever be sentenced to jail. 
 
The researchers concluded that the two years at preschool nourished the children not only intellectually but also gave them social skills, courage, and perseverance.  This combination of character strength,  also called Grit, was later responsible for their success in life. The 15,000 dollars invested in putting those kids into preschool, later benefited the entire society, mainly through a reduction in crime.  The total return of investment was estimated to be at a 195,000 dollars.
 
In 2006 Nobel Prize-winning economist James Heckman published what became known as the Heckman Curve.  It shows the return of investments in education, which is the highest in the early years. Governments have since started to act.  In Germany, parents get a lot of financial support to raise their kids.  In Japan, mothers or fathers can take a full year of paid leave.  In France, all children go to Kindergarten free of charge. 
 
If you happen to be in charge, know that with every extra minute you spend encouraging and talking to that little troublemaker, you might be doing him a favor for life. According to the University of Michigan: ""regular family dinners are a stronger predictor of good grades than doing homework.""",352822,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNgp1_B-6c8
ShapesüîπÔ∏èLesson 4üîπÔ∏èPART 1üîπÔ∏è Educational video for children (Early childhood development).,Little Academy TV,"Learning shapes - an effective learning video for young children, in which they learn basic geometric shapes easily and quickly, without additional efforts on your part.

In Spanish: https://youtu.be/qCu6qVhNldI
In Russian: https://youtu.be/ZQRHIZu-V6s

In this lesson, your child will see basic geometric shapes on the screen and hear their names, thus associating the shape with its name. Besides, the shapes will have different colors that your child has already learned from our previous videos. Children do not need to constantly look at the screen - it is sufficient that they do their own thing and occasionally glance at the screen.  Multiple repetitions ensure that the child will see the shape a few times and remember its name.  You also do not need to make any additional effort - simply turn on the video, when the child is playing in the same room, and the child will learn these shapes without any effort on your part.

The video is accompanied by beautiful classical music, which also contributes to the musical development of the child as well as the child‚Äôs intellect.

Our videos:

Lesson 1. Colors. https://youtu.be/E1mW7nqC8Ck
In Spanish: https://youtu.be/b0QYPHOCpp8
In Russian: https://youtu.be/m9Kv2x3jxec
Introduction of the 12 basic colors. Multiple repetitions of colors will ensure that the child sees and memorizes them.

Lesson 2. Colors. https://youtu.be/ZA9MeeKXCOE
In Spanish: https://youtu.be/e6ixMHn7FrY
In Russian: https://youtu.be/f0s_ZiwIW1g
In this lesson, colors go faster one by one, which challenges your child's speed of perception.

Lesson 3. Colors. https://youtu.be/n8MUFVz3EY4
In Spanish: https://youtu.be/A7CVpOZF2IA
In Russian: https://youtu.be/W54chT4ePQs
Putting together colored stackers, making funny faces from Play-Doh, and dissolving paint in water.

Lesson 5. Shapes. https://youtu.be/3LUe0QyCxKg
In Spanish: https://youtu.be/5jEwjnMLgQc
In Russian: https://youtu.be/LfP6VoedJRQ
A child learns more advanced geometric shapes that are painted in colors familiar from our previous videos.

Lesson 6. Shapes. https://youtu.be/6GJv0uIacic
In Russian: https://youtu.be/FlzFTxVehBg
Making geometric shapes from poms and beads, painting those shapes, and finding them in pictures.

Lesson 7. Big and small. https://youtu.be/-6QBmTrJlSQ
In Russian: https://youtu.be/E6XRDK3LQ08
Learning object sizes, comparing objects, and learning how objects can be the same, similar, and different.

Our educational videos are designed for babies, toddlers, and young children under age of 7. Our early development and early learning video lessons are a part of our early childhood program and created in the form of cartoons for babies, toddlers, and young children, as well as early learning videos that teach babies, toddlers and kids the basic concepts of real world (such as colors, shapes, sizes, numbers, letters, counting, reading, basic arithmetic, time, educational games, memory, attention, imagination, etc.). So our educational videos for young children play a role of early learning videos for babies, toddlers and young children focusing on early education, early learning, child development, early childhood development, and early childhood education.

What is the most important influence on child development | Tom Weisner | TEDxUCLA,TEDx Talks,"If you could do one thing - the most important thing - to influence the life of a young child, what would that be (it‚Äôs likely not what you first bring to mind)? We want to improve the wellbeing of children - our own, in our community, and in the world, so thinking globally about this question is vital.

Tom Weisner is an emeritus professor of anthropology and psychiatry at UCLA.  He studies and teaches about culture and human development; families and children at risk; and evidence-informed policies to improve the lives of children and families.  He has done research in Kenya on the effects on children and parents of rural-urban migration; in Delhi, India on families and children with autism; supports for working poor families in Wisconsin; families with children with disabilities in Los Angeles; hippie and countercultural families and children in California; sibling caretaking and education in Hawaii; non-parental and sibling caretaking around the world; and gratitude and school achievement among Latino adolescents and families in Los Angeles. He has served on the Board of the NGO ChildFund International. He went to Reed College (BA) and Harvard (PhD). He is married to Susan Meade Weisner, and has two sons and four beautiful grandchildren.

Technology in education: A tool on whose terms,GEM Report UNESCO,"The 2023 Global Education Monitoring Report
argues that education systems should always
ensure that learners‚Äô interests are placed at the
center and that digital technologies are used to
support an education based on human interaction
rather than aiming at substituting it.
It examines the education challenges for which
appropriate use of technology can offer solutions,
while recognizing that many of the current
solutions proposed may also be detrimental.
The report examines issues of access, equity,
and inclusion in education, looking at ways through
which technology can help reach disadvantaged
learners but also ensure more knowledge reaches
more learners in more engaging and cheaper
formats. It focuses on how quality can be improved,
both in teaching and learning basic skills, and in
developing the digital skills needed in daily life.
It recognizes the role of technology in system
management with special reference to assessment
data and other education management information
that can be widely used for planning.

Complexity |#shorts #educational #science #education #technology #coding#programming#computerscience,aryanlovescode,"computational complexity, a measure of the amount of computing resources (time and space) that a particular algorithm consumes when it runs. Computer scientists use mathematical measures of complexity that allow them to predict, before writing the code, how fast an algorithm will run and how much memory it will require. Such predictions are important guides for programmers implementing and selecting algorithms for real-world applications.

Computational complexity is a continuum, in that some algorithms require linear time (that is, the time required increases directly with the number of items or nodes in the list, graph, or network being processed), whereas others require quadratic or even exponential time to complete (that is, the time required increases with the number of items squared or with the exponential of that number). At the far end of this continuum lie intractable problems‚Äîthose whose solutions cannot be efficiently implemented. For those problems, computer scientists seek to find heuristic algorithms that can almost solve the problem and run in a reasonable amount of time.

Further away still are those algorithmic problems that can be stated but are not solvable; that is, one can prove that no program can be written to solve the problem. A classic example of an unsolvable algorithmic problem is the halting problem, which states that no program can be written that can predict whether or not any other program halts after a finite number of steps. The unsolvability of the halting problem has immediate practical bearing on software development. For instance, it would be frivolous to try to develop a software tool that predicts whether another program being developed has an infinite loop in it (although having such a tool would be immensely beneficial).",1018,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kmo1EFqLW8M
